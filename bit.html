    <p>Using a computational algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW), no one is able to block or censor your transactions.</p>
    <p>Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin since you own it; it's not housed at any central bank or company.<br> You can be your own bank with Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>The network is distributed globally among many thousands of nodes (computers) and millions of users where you don't have to rely on trusted third-parties.</p>
