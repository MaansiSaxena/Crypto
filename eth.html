    <p>The lack of a supply cap is one of the biggest disadvantages of Dogecoin. Unlike Bitcoin and the Ada cryptocurrency of Cardano, which are deflationary in nature because they have a predefined cap on supply to create scarcity and potentially increase its value in the future, it is deflationary. Cryptocurrencies with no supply cap are unideal assets to hedge against inflation</p>
    <p>Dogecoin has a relatively poor technical support despite its growing community of users and supporters. The development team is not as big as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Furthermore, the product roadmap is not as clear as these cryptocurrency market giants</p>
